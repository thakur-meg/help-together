##Inspiration

In world where being heard can bring about change, Help Together is a non-judgemental platform to voice serve as the voice of those who suffer from mental health issues.

##What it does

It is a platform where anyone can login with their Google accounts and join the conversations around mental health issues.

* Posts: The audience can make posts about the issues that call out to them the most. They can also seek advise from the fellow audience members in the cause of need.

* Like/Share/Comments: One can show their support for other's posts through liking or sharing their posts. Commenting can be a huge form of support too.

* Bot: A bot trained to answer queries related to mental health is also available on the platform in case of need.


##How we built it

The website is built using HTML, CSS, Tailwind with React, GraphQL, TailwindCSS .

Challenges we ran into

Working with GraphQL for the first time was a challenging endeavour which taught me a lot.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud of the project I submitted and all the new things I learned through it.

##What we learned

I learned how to work with a few different backend apis.

##What's next for Help Together

The next aim for Eventall is to make it more scalable and easily accessible. I am also hoping to add volunteer login to moderate the content and add an option to make client side tags.
